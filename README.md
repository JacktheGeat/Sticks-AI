Sticks Game


It's got a couple different versions, basically you make a pile of sticks, and you chose between 1 and 3. Whoever picks the last stick loses.
The "AI" basically picks random numbers of sticks until it wins, after which it will remember what it did, and be more likely to choose those same numbers when in the same situation again. very simple, very dumb.
